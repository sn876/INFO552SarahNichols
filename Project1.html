   <p> This project consists of storyboarding, wireframing and ultimately prototyping the Hangry app, which automates the process of the restaraunt dining experience. This was completed as part of INFO691 at Drexel University. Wireframes and storyboards included were done by myself. Team members storyboards and wireframes are not included in the gallery.</p>

<h2>Product Description</h2>

<p>This product is an app/platform called Hangry. This design aims to create a system that automates the process of visiting a restaurant. As part of this system diners will be able to find/see vacant tables and reserve or occupy them. The same system will allow diners to browse the menu and enter their order at any time throughout their visit. The process is full circle, being used by both diners and restaurant staff. After the diner orders their food, the cooks receive the orders through the back end of the Hangry app. After the cook has prepared the order, the server is notified and delivers the order upon completion. If the diner has an issue at any point during the process, the system will allow them to signal for assistance. After the diner has completed their meal, they can pay for their order using different options within the system. After payment has been received, staff are alerted that the table needs to be cleaned. After the staff completes the cleaning of the table, the system shows the table is available for the next diner.</p>  

<h2>Storyboards and Exploration</h2>

<p>Several storyboards were created as part of this group project. For my portfolio I am including only the parts that I was responsible for creating. The process included are: the ability to find/see vacant tables and reserve or occupy them, and diners browsing and ordering from the menu.</p>
 
<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>The storyboard was created by Sarah Nichols to document the process of a user finding vacant tables and reserving/occupying them. This wireframe highlights the use of the Hangry app with use through the user’s mobile phone. The link for this wireframe can be found <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/swvulr0/pzdg078">here.</a></p>

 <h1>Comprehensive Design Justification</h1>

<h2>Design decisions</h2>

<p>During the design process the team decided to divide up the storyboard specifications. We discussed in Microsoft Teams chat details about what our app would be called, and we decided on “Hangry”. We each took two scenarios and hand sketched our storyboards based on the criteria provided. After the storyboards were complete the team decided on which two processes we would use to wireframe. We decided this by choosing items that we thought would show diversity within the process, both the back end (cooks/servers) as well as the customer end.</p>


<p>The wireframes were completed using Balsamiq Cloud as their designs are more life-like and it is an easy-to-use product. When designing the wireframes, we decided to use Olive Garden as our restaurant placeholder. This app could be utilized with any restaurant that desired to use it.</p>  

<p>During the design process we tried to ensure we automated as many of the processes as we could by exploring the possibility of eliminating tickets that you might see at a traditional restaurant. We also eliminated the server having to go to the table to take an order unless the diner had questions that could not be answered by looking at the app/kiosk. We decided that the user could order food with a QR code that is provided at each table, and if they did not have access to a cell phone, they could utilize provided kiosks containing iPads, provided to each table. Users can also use the kiosks to pay by cash or with credit card.</p>


<p>To further automate the process, once payment has been made, a notification is provided to the servers and bussers which informs them a table will be ready to clean soon. After the table is cleaned, they can put this information into the system where the app alerts the next guest that the table is available, thus automating the process from start to finish.</p> 

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>We conducted this process in one live session with team members over teams. In our live meeting, we collaboratively brainstormed the outline of the system and assigned roles for each member. We decided to have a deadline of Sunday at 8:00 p.m. for all drafts to be completed and uploaded for review. We met on Teams Chat on Sunday evening to discuss the paper and other details of the project. The remainder of the collaboration was through the chat function in teams about the drafts and outlines. </p>
